    "Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, known as **tweets** .\n",
    "\n",
    "* A tweet can have at most 280 characters.\n",
    "* More than 319 million monthly active users (2016)\n",
    "* 400 million tweets per day\n",
    "* Tweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers.\n",
    "* Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a **retweet**.\n",
    "* 44 percent of user accounts have never tweeted\n",
    "* Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of **hashtags  \\#**\n",
    "* The **@** sign followed by a username is used to mention other users.\n",
    "* A word, phrase, or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a **trending topic**: https://twitter.com/whatstrending.\n"
